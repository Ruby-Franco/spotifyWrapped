# Spotify Wrapped: Data Analysis and API’s

## Motivation
   As we all know, since 2019, we have been graced with the lovely app feature of Spotify wrapped. Typically, this feature is quite extensive. It usually gives us a lot of information about our listening habits throughout this year. However, the spotify wrapped dropped last week and the general consensus of the public is it missed the mark. I am not proposing to replace spotify wrapped with my own version, but I want an insight of my own and see what information and data analysis I could extract using the same data they use. Initially, I plan to use solely my data and eventually extend the project to work the intended user’s data. 

## My Proposed Project
  My project is to use my own current spotify data using API’s and output a dashboard with patterns and trends seen from my data. I plan to use Python and Flask/Django to execute this idea. Using Python allows me to utilize the pandas and Plotly libraries that facilitate data analysis and works well with JSON files. For output, I plan on using a simple Flask web app to display my results. I will host it online for others to see using Heroku or PythonAnywhere. 
	A potential goal is to expand this project so that any user can utilize their own spotify data and see their own patterns and trends analyzed. 

## Functionalities 
**Data Extraction**: I plan to use Spotify’s API to extract data. 


**Data Analysis**: 
  I will use Python libraries to analyze the extracted data and look for any patterns and trends. Some ideas in mind are top artists, favorite songs broken up for specific days, months, weeks and year.

  
**Data Visualization**: In order to showcase said patterns and trends, I will create data visuals that convey the message in a clear and concise manner.  

**DashBoard**: I plan to incorporate a dashboard using Flask/Django that enhances the UI/UX of my project. It is essential to have the front end and back end tie in well together.


## Feasibility Analysis and Challenges
 A few potential challenges could be the API integration as it is my first time working with Spotify’s API and implementing OAuth which could be a learning curve. Another issue could be creating a visually appealing dashboard. I believe there is a fine line between design that enhances the data and design that brings down the comprehension of the data. Lastly, deploying my project using Heroku and PythonAnywhere could be an issue as it is my first time using these platforms.
  I believe it is a good feasible project, because I have taken CS 105 - DATA ANALYSIS METHODS and feel comfortable working with Python's libraries Pandas and can use data analysis methods to analyze patterns and trends.
